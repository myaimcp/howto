Prepared by: Srinivasan Sankar – Founder / CEO, AgentisIQ
Date: July 1, 2025

## Executive Summary

The proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation, embedded within the "One Big Beautiful Bill" (H.R. 1), offers Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance carriers a transformative opportunity to redefine profitability. By suspending state and local oversight of AI systems involved in interstate commerce, this legislation creates a decade-long window for insurers to deploy specialized vertical Agentic AI—autonomous systems capable of independent decision-making—to amplify historically effective, profit-driven strategies. These strategies, including delaying claims, denying valid claims, aggressively defending lawsuits, and devaluing or invalidating claims through intimidation or fabricated fraud allegations, can now be scaled with unprecedented efficiency.

Yet, this regulatory freedom comes with significant risks: reputational damage, federal intervention, litigation exposure, and growing public distrust of AI. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap for P&C insurers to harness Agentic AI for maximum profitability while mitigating these challenges. Key recommendations include discreet AI deployment, precision targeting with data, robust litigation defenses, adherence to federal boundaries, and proactive public perception management. Insurers that balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability during this moratorium can secure a lasting competitive edge.

## Introduction

The "One Big Beautiful Bill" (H.R. 1), currently under review in the U.S. Senate, proposes a 10-year moratorium on state and local regulation of AI models, systems, and automated decision tools engaged in interstate commerce. If enacted, this would halt states’ ability to enforce existing AI-related laws or enact new ones, leaving federal oversight as the primary constraint—a framework that remains broad and not AI-specific. For P&C insurers, this regulatory pause unlocks the potential to leverage Agentic AI, an advanced class of autonomous systems that can analyze data, make decisions, and execute actions without human intervention.

Historically, P&C carriers have relied on big data and predictive analytics to implement cost-saving tactics often at odds with customer-centric models. The moratorium amplifies this capability, enabling insurers to revisit and enhance these strategies with cutting-edge technology, free from state-level interference. This white paper examines the opportunities and risks of this regulatory shift, offering actionable insights for insurance executives to optimize profitability while navigating a complex landscape of legal, ethical, and reputational considerations.

## The Problem: Historical Tactics and the Regulatory Gap

### Historical Profit-Driven Strategies in P&C Insurance

P&C insurers have long employed tactics to prioritize cost reduction over policyholder satisfaction, including:

- **Delaying Claims**: Slow processing, excessive documentation demands, and extended investigations pressured claimants into accepting reduced settlements.
- **Denying Claims**: Valid claims, especially high-value personal injury cases, were routinely denied to limit payouts.
- **Defending Against Lawsuits**: Aggressive legal defenses made litigation costly and unappealing for policyholders.
- **Devaluing or Invalidating Claims**: Tactics like "filling the cups"—using intimidation or fabricated fraud allegations—discouraged claimants from pursuing full compensation.

While effective, these approaches often strained customer relationships and invited regulatory scrutiny. The proposed moratorium changes this dynamic by removing state oversight, creating a rare opportunity to revive and refine these tactics with AI.

### The Regulatory Gap: A Decade of Opportunity

The moratorium would:

- **Suspend State and Local AI Regulation**: No new state laws or enforcement of existing ones would apply to AI systems in interstate commerce, including insurance operations.
- **Maintain Limited Federal Oversight**: Federal laws (e.g., FTC rules on deceptive practices) persist but lack the specificity to comprehensively address AI-driven insurance tactics.
- **Foster Legal Ambiguity**: Vague exceptions (e.g., laws avoiding "undue burdens" on AI) could delay enforcement through prolonged legal disputes.

This regulatory vacuum offers P&C insurers a 10-year runway to deploy AI-driven strategies with minimal state-level resistance, provided they navigate federal constraints and public perception carefully.

## Analysis: Amplifying Historical Tactics with Agentic AI

Agentic AI’s ability to process vast datasets and act autonomously can supercharge traditional insurance tactics. Below, we explore its application to each strategy:

### 1. Automating Claims Delays
- **AI-Powered Bureaucracy**: AI can orchestrate intricate claims processes, automatically requesting additional documentation or clarifications at each step to prolong resolution timelines. For instance, a system could detect minor inconsistencies and trigger follow-ups, wearing down claimants.
- **Predictive Targeting**: By analyzing claimant profiles—factoring in financial distress or past settlement behavior—AI can prioritize delays for those most likely to accept lower payouts, optimizing cost savings.

### 2. Optimizing Claims Denials
- **Algorithmic Denial Engines**: Trained on historical data, AI can identify denial-prone claim patterns and reject them using proprietary, opaque criteria. This reduces transparency and complicates appeals.
- **Bias Amplification**: Absent state fairness mandates, AI could disproportionately target vulnerable groups (e.g., low-income policyholders), increasing denial rates where resistance is weakest.

### 3. Enhancing Litigation Defense
- **AI-Driven Legal Insights**: AI can analyze legal precedents, claimant histories, and judicial trends to craft tailored defenses, identifying cases where aggressive litigation will deter action.
- **Automated Counterclaims**: Upon lawsuit filings, AI could instantly generate counterclaims or procedural hurdles, escalating costs for claimants and discouraging pursuit.

### 4. Manufacturing Fraudulent Appearances to Devalue or Invalidate Claims
- **Fraud Detection as Leverage**: AI can flag legitimate claims as suspicious using tenuous patterns—e.g., multiple prior claims or flagged demographics—mirroring past "filling the cups" tactics at scale.
- **Digital Intimidation**: By scouring claimants’ online activity (e.g., social media posts suggesting post-injury activity), AI can compile “evidence” to pressure withdrawals or settlements.

## Risks to Consider

The moratorium’s opportunities are tempered by significant risks:

- **Reputational Damage**: High-profile AI abuses could spark customer pushback, amplified by social media and advocacy groups, eroding brand trust.
- **Federal Intervention**: Widespread exploitation might trigger federal regulators (e.g., FTC, DOJ) or Congress to enact AI-specific laws, closing the regulatory gap prematurely.
- **Litigation Exposure**: Federal consumer protection laws still apply, and policyholders could pursue lawsuits if AI tactics cross into deceptive or unfair practices.
- **Public Distrust of AI**: With over 50% of Americans wary of AI (Pew Research), aggressive tactics could deepen skepticism, impacting the industry’s social license to operate.

## Recommendations: Strategic Implementation of AI Tactics

To capitalize on the moratorium while mitigating risks, insurers should adopt these strategies:

### 1. Deploy AI Aggressively but Discreetly
- **Opaque Systems**: Use non-transparent AI algorithms for delays and denials, minimizing traceability and contestability.
- **Subtle Execution**: Favor incremental delays (e.g., staged documentation requests) over overt rejections to avoid scrutiny.

### 2. Leverage Data for Precision
- **Selective Targeting**: Apply AI tactics to claimants likely to relent (e.g., those with urgent financial needs) while fast-tracking visible cases to maintain goodwill.
- **Fraud Fabrication**: Design AI to flag claims with profit-aligned “fraud indicators” (e.g., high-cost regions), even with weak evidence.

### 3. Strengthen Litigation Defenses
- **Proactive Analysis**: Use AI to preemptively assess lawsuit risks, building defenses or counterclaims before filings occur.
- **Cost Barriers**: Automate legal processes to inflate claimant expenses, deterring litigation through financial pressure.

### 4. Stay Within Federal Boundaries
- **Legal Compliance**: Avoid blatant violations of federal laws (e.g., FTC deception rules) to limit exposure.
- **Regulatory Monitoring**: Track federal developments and adapt AI strategies if oversight tightens.

### 5. Mitigate Public Backlash
- **Strategic Messaging**: Promote AI as an efficiency tool (e.g., “enhanced fraud detection”) to mask profit motives.
- **Dual Approach**: Apply ethical AI in customer-facing areas (e.g., chatbots) while reserving aggressive tactics for back-end processes.

## Conclusion

The 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation presents P&C insurers with a pivotal opportunity to leverage Agentic AI for profit maximization. By automating delays, optimizing denials, fortifying legal defenses, and devaluing claims through AI-driven fraud detection, carriers can reduce costs and enhance margins with minimal state oversight. However, success hinges on navigating reputational, legal, and federal risks with precision and foresight.

Insurers that act decisively—deploying AI discreetly, targeting strategically, and managing perception—can emerge as industry leaders. The moratorium tilts the competitive landscape in favor of those willing to revisit profit-first strategies with modern tools, but long-term sustainability requires balancing these gains against potential backlash. The next decade will reward bold yet calculated moves.

Insurance executives should immediately evaluate their AI capabilities and develop tailored strategies to seize this regulatory window. The clock is ticking—act now to outpace competitors.
