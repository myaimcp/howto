**This structure gives a comprehensive, investor- and team-ready blueprint tailored for an AI-native, next-generation insurance company like AgentisIQ.**

### Product Overview

- **Product Name:** AgentisIQ
- **Product Type:** Full-stack, AI-native web and mobile platform for property & casualty (P&C) insurance
- **Target Users:**
  - Tech-savvy homeowners and renters seeking fast, self-service insurance
  - Digital-first small and mid-sized businesses (for commercial P&C)
  - Partners/agents (for embedded insurance opportunities)
- **Core Problem:**
  - Traditional P&C insurance is slow and manual—applications, claims, policy changes, and customer support require excessive time and human labor. AgentisIQ empowers users with frictionless, transparent, and fast insurance across the full lifecycle, powered by AI with "human-in-the-loop" governance only as needed.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Claims automation rate (% of claims fully handled by AI)
  - NPS/customer satisfaction (especially relating to speed and ease)
  - Policy growth/retention
  - Loss ratio and operational expense ratio (vs. industry benchmarks)
  - Average time to quote, bind, and settle claims

### Business Context

- **Business Goals:**
  - Rapid policyholder growth in initial key states/regions
  - Achieve high claims automation (>60%) for major claim types in year 1
  - Reach break-even within 3-4 years via superior expense ratios
  - Establish a brand recognized for transparency, tech innovation, and superior digital experience
- **Strategic Priority:**  
  - **High.** The insurance industry is entering a new phase of AI disruption; launching as a digital-native, AI-native insurer now positions AgentisIQ for rapid share gains and structural cost advantages as incumbents struggle to adapt.
- **Market Opportunity:**
  - U.S. property & casualty insurance alone exceeds $800B/year in premiums
  - Market is ripe for digital transformation; Lemonade, Hippo, and Root show tech interest but no dominant winner yet
  - AI-native automation (claims, underwriting, service) can unlock massive savings and new customer segments
- **Competitive Landscape:**
  - Differentiators: End-to-end AI workflow (not just digital front-end); true "human in the loop" for complexity, not routine; radical automation in onboarding, servicing, and claims; API-driven for partnerships and embedded insurance
  - Competitors: Lemonade, Hippo, Root (digital/AI-first); State Farm, Allstate, Progressive (legacy incumbents adopting some tech)
- **Resource Constraints:**
  - Timeline: 12 months to MVP; full regulatory approval may take longer
  - Budget: Constrained by licensing, actuarial, and compliance costs
  - Team: Need actuaries, ML/AI/data specialists, insurance operations experts, cloud/data engineering, product/UX, compliance/legal

### User Research

- **User Personas:**
  - Primary: Digital native renters/homeowners (ages 22-45, urban/suburban, high adoption of fintech/insuretech)
  - Secondary: Small business owners; partners embedding insurance offers
- **User Pain Points:**
  - Slow, manual claims and policy changes
  - Opaque pricing, hard-to-understand coverage
  - Poor mobile/online experience, excessive paperwork
  - Lack of real-time updates or 24/7 assistance
  - Distrust in insurers (“denial by default” feeling)
- **User Goals:**
  - Buy and manage insurance anytime, anywhere
  - Receive instant, fair quotes and fast claims payout
  - Understand their coverage and costs simply
  - Escalate to a human only for complex or emotional needs
- **User Workflows:**
  - Current: Multiple calls/emails, long apps and waits, little transparency; claims take days to weeks
  - Ideal: 90%+ of workflow is self-service, from quote to claim; fast, clear digital interfaces; escalation path for edge cases; proactive alerts and advice from AI
- **User Feedback:**
  - Early insurer pilot users praised instant quote/claim experiences (per Lemonade), but want options for complex issues/escalation; universally negative on legacy process delays

### Technical Context

- **Current Architecture:** (for prototype)
  - Cloud-native (AWS/GCP/Azure); microservices with modular AI components (NLP for onboarding/service, CV for claim photo/video, ML for underwriting/fraud)
  - Secure, compliant data storage; event-driven pipeline to enable real-time actions
- **Technical Dependencies:**
  - Core insurance platform (policy admin, billing); 3rd party data for underwriting (property, weather, financial)
  - Regulator APIs, KYC/identity, payment, e-signature integrations
  - Generative and predictive AI engines
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Instant quote time (<10s), claim decisions in minutes (routine cases)
  - Scale to 100k+ concurrent users; failover and auto-scaling
  - >99.95% uptime SLA for critical policy/billing/claims modules
- **Security Requirements:**
  - HIPAA/PCI/SOC2 compliance; strong encryption in transit and at rest
  - Least-privilege access control; regular audits; incident response plans
  - Consent-driven data usage and explainable AI
- **Platform Requirements:**
  - Responsive web app (desktop/mobile)
  - Native iOS and Android apps
  - Admin dashboard for underwriters and escalation/human-in-the-loop review
