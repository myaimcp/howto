# Think Faster, Talk Smarter: How to Speak Successfully When You're Put on the Spot by Matt Abrahams

## The Truth About Spontaneous Speaking
- 85% of our professional communication is unscripted
- It's a skill you can learn and improve
- Structure creates freedom, not restriction
- Give yourself permission to be boring
- Perfectionism stalls conversation
- Perfectionism leads to paralysis
- Practice "shooting the wrong thing" in low stakes or practice scenarios to reduce fear

## The Six-Step Method

### 1. Get Out of Your Own Way
- See questions as gifts - they show what matters
- Mistakes are simply "missed takes" – chances to try again

- Focus on helping, not impressing

### 3. Listen Intently

- Choose the right framework for the situation
- Practice until structures become second nature
- Let structure do the heavy lifting
