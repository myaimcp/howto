AI for Perk Optimization: Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to using AI for perk optimization with your Amex card statements:

Because many premium card perks are hard to track and often left unused ("breakage"), here's how to using AI to analyze your Amex statements. By uploading your statement PDF to an AI chatbot and asking if you're maximizing all your eligible perks, you can ensure you're getting the full value. This approach threatens industry profits but helps consumers use all benefits.

1. **Download Your Amex Statement:**
   - Log in to your American Express account through the official website or app.
   - Navigate to your recent statements.
   - Download the monthly statement as a PDF file to your computer or phone.

2. **Choose an AI Chatbot with PDF Upload Capabilities:**
   - Select an AI assistant (e.g., Perplexity, ChatGPT Plus, or similar) that supports PDF uploads.
   - Make sure the chatbot can read and analyze documents for context and data extraction.

3. **Upload Your Statement:**
   - Open the AI chatbot’s interface.
   - Look for an “Upload” or “Attach File” button, usually in the chat window.
   - Upload your Amex statement PDF.

4. **Ask the AI to Analyze Your Perks:**
   - In the chat, type a prompt such as:
     - “Can you check this Amex statement and see if I’m using all my eligible perks and credits?”
     - “Am I maximizing all potential benefits and statement credits based on this statement?”
   - Some chatbots may understand even simpler prompts like “Find unused perks.”

5. **Review the AI’s Response:**
   - The AI will scan your statement for qualifying offers, unused credits, or perks specific to your card (e.g., travel credits, dining credits, Uber cash, airline fee credits, etc.).
   - It should list perks you’ve used, missed, or underutilized, with possible tips to maximize value.

6. **Take Action:**
   - Use the feedback to activate any missed perks or redeem available credits before they expire.
   - Set reminders for recurring monthly or annual credits to minimize “breakage.”

7. **Optional – Automation and Tracking:**
   - You can ask the AI to create a monthly checklist or calendar reminder for perk deadlines.
   - Some AI apps can generate spreadsheets with usage data for future optimization.

**Tip:**  
- Always check that the AI chatbot is secure and reputable, especially as you’re uploading sensitive financial documents.

Following these steps can help ensure you *actually* benefit from all the premium perks you’re paying for, closing the gap between promised and realized card value.
