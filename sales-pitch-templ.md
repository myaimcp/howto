**[Sales Pitch Deck Template: The 5 Elements of a Brilliant Sales Narrative]**

***

**1. Name a Big, Relevant Change in the World**
- Start with an undeniable shift taking place (not talking about your product/company yet).
- Example structure:
  - “Today, [industry/market/way of doing things] is fundamentally changing because of [macro trend or shift].”
  - “We are now living in a world where [describe the shift briefly].”

*Slide/Notes field:*
> The big change affecting your audience:
> _______________________________________________________

***

**2. Show There’ll Be Winners and Losers**
- Frame the new landscape: adapting means positive outcomes, sticking to the status quo means falling behind.
- Example structure:
  - “History shows: when these shifts happen, [type of companies/people] win, and [others] lose.”
  - Use relevant stats, dramatic examples, or case studies of “winners” and “losers.”

*Slide/Notes field:*
> What makes the winners? 
> _______________________________________________________
>
> What makes the losers?
> _______________________________________________________
>
> Data or stories to illustrate:
> _______________________________________________________

**3. Tease the Promised Land**
- Paint a compelling, aspirational vision of the future (without jumping yet to your product).
- This is the desired end state, enabled by responding to the change.
- Example structure:
  - “Imagine a world where [describe the Promised Land].”
  - “Here’s what it looks like when you get it right…”

*Slide/Notes field:*
> Describe the Promised Land (the ideal future your solution helps enable):
> _______________________________________________________

***

**4. Introduce Features as “Magic Gifts” for Overcoming Obstacles**
- Only now, frame your product/service as the “magic gifts”—the critical tools or capabilities prospects need to get to the Promised Land.
- Example structure:
  - “But reaching the Promised Land isn’t easy—here’s what stands in the way: [obstacle].”
  - “Here’s how we help: [Feature/Benefit #1], [Feature/Benefit #2], etc.”
- Each feature is positioned as essential to conquering a specific obstacle.

*Slide/Notes field:*
> List the key obstacles:
> _______________________________________________________
>
> Map each of your product’s unique strengths to those obstacles (“magic gifts”):
> _______________________________________________________

***

**5. Present Evidence That You Can Make the Story Come True**
- Success stories, testimonials, quantified results, or powerful demo moments.
- Use the “someone like you” approach for maximum impact (“Here’s someone similar to you who reached the Promised Land with our help”).
- Example structure:
  - “Here’s how [customer X] did it…”
  - Metrics, before/after results, or supporting proof.

*Slide/Notes field:*
> Success stories, data, or evidence to prove your credibility:
> _______________________________________________________
