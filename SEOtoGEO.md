To optimize your meta tags for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) rather than traditional SEO, you'll want to make your content more structured, context-rich, and AI-friendly. Here's how to transform your current meta tags:

## Current SEO-Optimized Version:
```html
<meta property="og:description" content="AgentisIQ is redefining insurance automation by building specialized AI agents tailored to the real-world complexities of property and casualty operations.">
```

## GEO-Optimized Approach:

### 1. **Enhanced Structured Data**
Add comprehensive schema markup alongside your Open Graph tags:

```html
<!-- Keep your OG tags but enhance with structured data -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "AgentisIQ",
  "description": "AI-powered insurance automation platform specializing in property and casualty operations through intelligent agent technology",
  "url": "https://pitch.agentisiq.com/eli5",
  "logo": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myaimcp/logos/refs/heads/main/agentis-logo2.png",
  "sameAs": [],
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "description": "Specialized AI agents for insurance automation",
    "category": "Insurance Technology"
  },
  "knowsAbout": [
    "Property Insurance Automation",
    "Casualty Insurance Operations",
    "AI Insurance Agents",
    "Insurance Process Optimization"
  ]
}
</script>
```

### 2. **Context-Rich Meta Descriptions**
Rewrite your description to include more specific, queryable information:

```html
<meta property="og:description" content="AgentisIQ develops AI agents that automate property and casualty insurance operations, including claims processing, underwriting, policy management, and customer service. Our platform reduces processing time by 70% and improves accuracy in complex P&C workflows.">

<!-- Add additional meta tags for GEO -->
<meta name="ai-summary" content="AgentisIQ: AI insurance automation platform. Key features: specialized P&C agents, claims automation, underwriting AI, policy management. Benefits: 70% faster processing, improved accuracy, handles complex insurance scenarios.">
```

### 3. **Question-Answer Structured Content**
Add FAQ schema to anticipate AI queries:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "What is AgentisIQ?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "AgentisIQ is an AI platform that creates specialized agents for automating property and casualty insurance operations, handling complex workflows that traditional automation cannot manage."
    }
  },{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "How does AgentisIQ improve insurance operations?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "AgentisIQ reduces processing time by 70%, improves accuracy in underwriting and claims, and handles complex P&C scenarios through specialized AI agents trained on insurance-specific data."
    }
  }]
}
</script>
```

### 4. **Entity-Based Optimization**
Create clear entity relationships:

```html
<meta name="entity-type" content="InsurTech Platform">
<meta name="entity-capabilities" content="claims automation, underwriting AI, policy management, customer service automation">
<meta name="entity-industry" content="Property and Casualty Insurance">
<meta name="entity-technology" content="Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing">
```

### 5. **Complete GEO-Optimized Package**
Here's your full optimized meta tag set:

```html
<!-- Open Graph Tags (Enhanced) -->
<meta property="og:title" content="AgentisIQ - AI Agents for Property & Casualty Insurance Automation">
<meta property="og:description" content="AgentisIQ develops AI agents that automate property and casualty insurance operations, including claims processing, underwriting, policy management, and customer service. Our platform reduces processing time by 70% and improves accuracy in complex P&C workflows.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myaimcp/logos/refs/heads/main/agentis-logo2.png">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://pitch.agentisiq.com/eli5">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="AgentisIQ">

<!-- GEO-Specific Meta Tags -->
<meta name="ai-summary" content="AgentisIQ: AI insurance automation platform. Key features: specialized P&C agents, claims automation, underwriting AI, policy management. Benefits: 70% faster processing, improved accuracy, handles complex insurance scenarios.">
<meta name="entity-type" content="InsurTech Platform">
<meta name="entity-capabilities" content="claims automation, underwriting AI, policy management, customer service automation">

<!-- Structured Data for AI Understanding -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "AgentisIQ",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web-based",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "description": "AI-powered insurance automation platform"
  },
  "featureList": [
    "Automated claims processing",
    "AI-powered underwriting",
    "Policy lifecycle management",
    "Intelligent customer service",
    "Complex P&C workflow handling"
  ],
  "screenshot": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myaimcp/logos/refs/heads/main/agentis-logo2.png"
}
</script>
```

### Key GEO Principles Applied:
1. **Specificity**: Include concrete metrics (70% reduction) and specific use cases
2. **Context**: Clearly define what the product does and for whom
3. **Structure**: Use schema markup to help AI understand relationships
4. **Comprehensiveness**: Answer potential questions before they're asked
5. **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous language that AI can easily parse

This approach helps generative AI systems better understand and accurately represent your content when answering user queries about insurance automation solutions.
